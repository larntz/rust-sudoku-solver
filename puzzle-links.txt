# backtracking algorithm

1. Start with 1 in first 0
2. Check if row / column / box already contains 1. 
2a. if yes, start over with 2
2b. if no, go to next zero starting 

if x > 9 we must start over at the next increment

1. Find next 0
2. i starts at 1, if i gets to 9 start the puzzle over at 1 
4a. if yes, go to 2 and increment i++
4b. if no, go to 1
